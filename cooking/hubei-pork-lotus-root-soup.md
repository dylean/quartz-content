This is one of my absolute favorite comfort foods from home. Pork Rib and Lotus Root Soup (排骨藕汤) is a signature dish from Hubei province. When done right, the broth turns a beautiful milky white, the lotus root becomes incredibly soft and starchy, and the ribs are so tender they practically fall apart. It's the kind of dish that warms you from the inside out.

Getting it right requires a few key techniques, which I'll share with you today.

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |

| Pork Ribs | ~750g - 1kg | Spare ribs or baby back ribs both work. |

### Seasonings

| Seasoning | Amount | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## The Three Secrets to Perfectly Tender Lotus Root

If your lotus root always turns out crunchy no matter how long you cook it, you're making one of these mistakes.

### 1. Choose the Right Variety

This is the most important step. There are two types of lotus root: crunchy (脆藕) and starchy (粉藕). You **must** use the starchy kind.

* ✅ **Look for**: Pale yellow skin with brown spots. Short, thick segments.
* ✅ **Test it**: When you cut it, you should see a white, starchy residue on your cutting board.
* ❌ **Avoid**: Pure white lotus root. This is the crunchy variety and will never become tender no matter how long you cook it.

### 2. Marinate the Lotus Root with Salt

Tossing the cut lotus root with salt before cooking does two things:

1. **Prevents oxidation**: The lotus root won't turn brown.
2. **Infuses flavor**: The salt penetrates the root, making it more savory.

### 3. Layer Correctly: Lotus Root on the Bottom

When cooking, always put the lotus root at the bottom of the pot, with the ribs on top. The lotus root needs more time to become tender, so placing it closer to the heat source ensures it cooks through completely.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Lotus Root

1. **Wash and peel** the lotus root.
2. **Cut** into large, irregular chunks (about 3-4 cm).
3. **Marinate**: Toss the chunks with about 12g of salt. Let it sit for **30 minutes**.
4. **Rinse (Optional)**: If you used a lot of salt, rinse the lotus root a few times before cooking.

### Step 2: Prepare the Ribs

1. **Soak** the ribs in cold water for **30 minutes**, changing the water a few times to remove blood.
2. **Blanch**: Place the ribs in a pot of cold water with scallions and ginger. Bring to a boil and cook for **3 minutes**, skimming off the foam.
3. **Rinse**: Remove the ribs and rinse them under **hot water**. Set aside.

### Step 3: Sear the Ribs

This step is optional but highly recommended for a richer broth.

1. Heat a little oil in a wok over medium heat. Add ginger slices and fry until fragrant.
2. Add the blanched ribs and stir-fry until the surface is slightly **golden brown**.
3. Pour in enough **boiling water** to cover the ribs. *Always use boiling water—cold water will make the meat tough.* Boil over high heat until the broth turns **milky white**.

### Step 4: The Long Simmer

**Pressure Cooker Method (Recommended)**

1. Place the marinated lotus root at the **bottom** of the pressure cooker.
2. Pour the ribs and broth on top. Add more boiling water until the water level is about 5cm above the ingredients.
3. Seal the lid. Bring to pressure over high heat, then reduce to medium-low.
4. Cook for **25 minutes** after pressure is reached.
5. Turn off heat and let the pressure release naturally.

**Clay Pot Method**

1. Layer lotus root at the bottom, ribs on top.
2. Add enough boiling water.
3. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer.
4. Cook for **2 to 2.5 hours**.

### Step 5: Season and Serve

1. Open the lid and season with salt to taste.
2. Add a **generous amount of white pepper**. This is key—Hubei-style soup is known for its peppery kick.
3. Optionally, add a pinch of MSG for extra umami.
4. Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped scallions.

## Pro Tip: Make the Broth Even Richer

Want an extra creamy, velvety broth? Take a few pieces of the cooked lotus root, blend them into a puree with some of the broth, and stir it back into the pot. The added starch will thicken the soup and intensify the lotus root flavor.

## What to Look For

| Element | Goal |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ribs** | Tender and flavorful. The meat should slide off the bone easily. |
| **Lotus Root** | Soft and starchy. It should break apart with a gentle press of your chopsticks. |
| **Broth** | Milky white, rich, and savory. |

## Quick Tips

* **Lotus root is a meal in itself**: Starchy lotus root is high in carbs. A bowl of this soup can replace rice.
* **Always use boiling water**: Adding cold water mid-cook will toughen the meat.
* **White pepper is non-negotiable**: Be generous. It's what makes this soup authentic.
* **Serve immediately**: The lotus root can oxidize and turn grayish if it sits too long.

Enjoy this taste of Hubei!
